#Data Structures

In this part, I'm going to bring some "OOP" style C code.

There is no special reasons for this, only because I think this may help organize those structures better.

To achieve this, each data structure will be wrapped in a `struct` and has a constructor.

Each data structure will have it's operation methods which are wrapped in it's `struct`. 

And all those "methods" will accept an structure pointer as `this` object.

######This chapter may takes longer than I think at the first time. But then I realized these structures maybe fundamentally for my further study. So my time is not wasted.
